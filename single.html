				<br />
				<p>Just think about only being 17 and trying to find your way through high school only to land in jail for something you are innocent of committing. Unfortunately, this isn’t just some hypothetical, this is the real story of Adnan Syed.</p>
				<p>It was from the show “Serial” that I came to know his story. A single statement of one witness was enough evidence for Adnan’s conviction. He’d been arrested after an accusation by one person; imagine something similar happening to you. This happened in 1999, a time when there were few CCTV’s or cell phone cameras and when teachers were laid-back. Consequently, you have no alibi because nobody was bothered by what you did. I would hate living in a world where you were guilty until proven innocent. </p>
				<p> Adnan had one piece of proof, one thing proving that he wasn’t there at the time on the murder, one alibi, three different witness saw him at the library on the same day and time of the murder, although when Adnan’s lawyer tried to reach out to them with a private investigator, they were scared off and pretended not to have witnessed him at the library because they feared he could be a murderer.</p>
				<p>Now, with his only Alibi out of the picture, he would have to go through years facing a seemingly endless amount of trials to try to get his life back, fighting back against a system that already failed him, while he tries to prove himself as innocent to a system that already deemed him guilty. After years of fighting in the justice system, Adnan Syed was eventually released in 2023. Some people do not believe he is innocent while others differ. The case shows us the imperfection and defectiveness in our judicial system. Thank you all for considering this perspective, follow us for more stories like this one.</p>
